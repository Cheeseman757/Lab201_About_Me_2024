            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I am John Thomas Gause III, originally from Tacoma, WA, and raised in Jackson, TN. 
                I proudly served in the United States Air Force, where I was stationed in Ramstein, Germany, 
                working as a registered mail clerk. I had the opportunity to deploy to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain 
                during my service. Currently, I am pursuing my passion for technology and software development 
                at Code Fellows, where I am immersed in learning Full-Stack Software Development with a focus on 
                JavaScript. This journey allows me to apply the skills and discipline acquired during my military 
                service to the dynamic and innovative field of software development.
